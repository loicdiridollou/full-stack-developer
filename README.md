# Full-Stack-Developer Nanodegree

This repository includes the different work files of the Udacity Full-Stack-Developer nanodegree that focuses mostly on backend development with a bit of frontend development for visual rendering and web browser interactions with the backend.
The tech stack that I used all along is mostly Python and some inputs of JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
